## Project Overview

This Java project provides a comprehensive overview of constructors, an essential concept in object-oriented programming. The codebase includes examples of different types of constructors, demonstrating how they are used to create and initialize objects in Java. Constructors are pivotal to object creation and are used to set up initial values for an object’s state.

## Features
- Demonstrates **default constructors** and **parameterized constructors**.
- Shows **constructor overloading** techniques.
- Illustrates **copy constructors** for object cloning.
- Code examples with explanations for each type of constructor.
- Sample test cases to showcase the use of constructors in various scenarios.

## Java Constructor Basics

Constructors in Java are special methods that initialize objects. Unlike regular methods, constructors:
- Have the same name as the class.
- Do not have a return type, not even `void`.
- Are automatically called when an object of a class is created.

### Types of Constructors

1. **Default Constructor**: A no-argument constructor provided by Java if no other constructors are defined in a class.
2. **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor that takes one or more parameters, allowing the user to assign custom initial values to an object's fields upon creation.

### Constructor Overloading

Constructor overloading allows a class to have multiple constructors with different parameters. This feature enhances flexibility, enabling objects to be created in various states.

### Copy Constructors

A **copy constructor** is used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object. It takes an instance of the same class as a parameter, replicating its field values.
